# Make Project

Make a project as easily as making a directory; with a few extra steps of course. Made with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) to make it fast, and not with [Go](https://golang.org/), because my Go development environment is quite broken and I perfer having my projects whereever I would like them.
